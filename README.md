# Craemon Datapacks Monorepo
This repository includes most of my datapacks. This is done to reduce the insane amount of tiny repositories I had before. It also provides an easy way of version updating them (provided no major changes apply to them). This is achieved using the included build python scripts. They allow me to reuse common files across multiple packs by merging multiple directories on build.
